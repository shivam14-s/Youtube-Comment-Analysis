# Youtube-Comment-Analysis

In this project, I used the Youtube API to scrape Youtube comment data and do a sentiment analysis on it.

The .ipynb file is the notebook I used for the intial base of my project. 

The web_scrpit.py file is a streamlit based dashboard which takes the Youtube Video URL as input and outputs the graphs and analytics which are in the .ipynb file onto the dash board.
